                    <p>My name is Ben You, I recently graduated from University of Houston with a Master of Science
                    degree in Information System Security. My paticular areas of interest in Information System Security are
                    Web Application Security and Malware Analysis, which is the main reason that I want to learn more about
                    Web Development since I need deeper knowledge about how the webpages and web applications are coded and
                    developed in order to defend the hackers. My other areas of interests in the field are network security
                    and penetration testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>I am a Christian. I proclaim Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior, without him, I wouldn't have become the man
                    I am tody. I love Christian songs and my favoriate band is Hillsong Worship. I like studing theology but I just
                    don't have enough time to do so recently.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In my spare time, I like watching TV shows and the show I am currently watching is Supernatural. Aside from 
                    Christian Music, I also like country and classic music. I play piano and go to gym weekly.
